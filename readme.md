Analysis has been carried out on a dataset from NHS Scotland, in order to give insights into the incidence of cancer in the NHS Borders in 1994 - 2018. 

In order to help the NHS to plan the provision of cancer treatment services, a variety of data visualisations were created to understand the following:

1. Cancer incidence over time
2. Trends in incidence by gender 
3. Most prevalent cancer sites
4. Comparison of NHS Borders to the rest of the Scottish Health Boards
5. Crude Rate of Trachea, Bronchus and Lung Cancers by Gender

## Cancer Incidence Over Time

From the plot, it can be seen that cancer incidence has increased overall from 1994 to 2018, however there is some irregularity. There were 518 incidences in 1994, compared to 828 incidences in 2018 - an increase by 59.8%.
